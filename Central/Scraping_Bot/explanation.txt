How to Use the Bot

Install Dependencies: Ensure you have the required libraries by running:

Set the Base URL: Replace "https://example.com" with the base URL of the site you want to scrape.

Define Endpoints: The endpoints list should contain paths of pages relative to the base URL. For example, if you want to scrape https://example.com/page1, add "page1" to the list.

Customize Data Processing: Modify the process_data method to extract the specific data you need from the page. The example provided extracts and prints all paragraph text.

Run the Bot: Execute the script. The bot will visit each endpoint, fetch the page content, process the data, and wait for a random interval between requests to help avoid detection.


What the Code Does
User Agent Randomization: The bot uses the fake_useragent library to generate random user-agent strings, making requests appear as if they come from different browsers.

Session Management: The requests.Session() object manages cookies and connection pooling, making the bot more efficient.

Error Handling: The fetch_page method includes basic error handling to manage failed requests.

Random Delays: The wait_random method introduces random delays between requests, reducing the likelihood of the bot being flagged as a scraper.

Modularity: The design allows you to add or modify functionality, such as extracting different types of data or handling JavaScript-rendered content.
